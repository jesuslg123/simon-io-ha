# Simon iO Re-authentication Guide

## Overview

The Simon iO integration now supports multiple ways to re-authenticate and update credentials without removing and re-adding the entire integration.

## Re-authentication Options

### 1. **Automatic Re-authentication**
- **When it happens**: Automatically triggered when tokens expire
- **What it does**: Prompts for password only (uses stored client credentials)
- **User action**: Enter your password when prompted

### 2. **Manual Re-authentication** 
- **When to use**: When you want to update all credentials (client ID, secret, username, password)
- **What it does**: Allows you to enter completely new credentials
- **User action**: Go to integration options and select "Re-authenticate with new credentials"

### 3. **Password-Only Update**
- **When to use**: When you only need to update your password
- **What it does**: Updates password while keeping existing client credentials
- **User action**: Go to integration options and select "Update password only"

- Authentication is tested during re-auth process

## Troubleshooting

### Re-authentication Fails
1. **Check your credentials** - Ensure they're correct
2. **Check your internet connection** - Simon iO API must be accessible
3. **Check Simon iO service status** - Service might be down
4. **Try manual re-authentication** - Use the full credential update

### Integration Not Responding
1. **Restart Home Assistant** - Sometimes needed after re-auth
2. **Check logs** - Look for authentication errors
3. **Remove and re-add integration** - Last resort option

### Credentials Not Updating
1. **Wait a few minutes** - Changes can take time to propagate
2. **Check integration status** - Should show "Connected"
3. **Test device control** - Try controlling a Simon device
